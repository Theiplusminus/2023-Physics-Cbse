Note : Questions number 34 and 35 are Case Study based questions.
Read the following paragraph and answer the questions.
34. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. The two conductors have equal and opposite charges with a potential difference between them. The capacitance of a capacitor depends on the geometrical configuration (shape, size and separation) of the system and also on the nature of the insulator separating the two conductors. They are used to store charges. Like resistors, capacitors can be arranged in series or parallel or a combination of both to obtain desired value of
capacitance.	4

telescopes.	4

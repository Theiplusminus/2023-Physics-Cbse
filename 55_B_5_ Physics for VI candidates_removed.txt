35. Diffraction of light : According to rectilinear propagation of light, light travels in a straight line. But Italian scientist Grimaldi discovered that light bends near the edges of the aperture of the obstacles whose size is comparable with the wavelength of light. This phenomenon of bending of light around the corners of an obstacle is called diffraction of light. If we place a screen in front of the slit, the diffraction pattern observed on it is of unequal widths and unequal intensities. The diffraction phenomenon can be explained on the basis of wave nature of light.
Based on the above facts, answer the following questions :
(i) What	is	the	most	essential	condition	for	observing diffraction ?						1
(ii) Which	characteristic	of	light	is	used	in	X-ray crystallography ?							1

for diffraction ? Explain.	2
